Router Threading and Interprocess Communication Guide
=====================================================

The Qpid Dispatch Router (qdrouterd) threading architecture is based
on two classes of threads:

 *) A Worker thread which interfaces with the Proton subsystem, and
 *) The Core Routing thread which manages the routing database and
performs forwarding.

In a running router there is a single Core Routing thread (core) and
one or more Worker threads.  The number of Worker threads is
determined by the router configuration setting "workerThreads", which
defaults to four.

IPC between these threads is done using Action queues, Work queues,
and manipulation of shared data.


Worker Threads
==============

The Worker thread is responsible for interfacing with the Proton
subsystem.  Only a worker thread can safely call directly into the
Proton library.  The core thread must communicate with a worker thread
in order to have the worker manipulate Proton state on the core's
behalf.

The Proton subsystem limits concurrency to a single connection.  That
is, only one thread can be processing a given Proton connection (and
all of its child elements, such as links and deliveries) at a time.
The router honors this requirement by restricting access to a given
Proton connection (and its children) to a single worker thread at a
time.  To say this another way, a particular Proton connection can be
processed by any worker threads but not concurrently.

A worker thread is driven by the Proton proactor API.  The worker's
main loop blocks on the proactor waiting for events, processes
incoming events, then blocks again.


Core Thread
===========

The one core thread has several responsibilities, including:

 *) Managing the forwarding state
 *) Forwarding messages across the router
 *) Forwarding disposition and settlement state changes across the router
 *) Managing link credit flow
 *) Running the management Agent

The core thread can be thought of as sitting in between the worker
threads, moving messages and state between them.

When a worker thread needs to forward a received message it passes the
message and associated delivery state to the core thread.  The core
thread uses address information from the message to determine the
outgoing link(s) for the message.  The core then queues the message to
the proper outgoing link(s).  The core wakes the worker thread(s) (via
the Proton proactor) so the message(s) can be written out the Proton
link.

When delivery disposition or settlement changes are detected by a
worker thread it notifies the core thread.  The core thread then
finds the link or delivery to which the changes need to be propagated
to.  This results in the core thread setting the new state in the
link/delivery and waking a worker thread to update the new state in
Proton.

The core also manages credit flow.  The core grants credit to inbound
links.  The core grants an initial batch of credit to a non-anonymous
link (a link with a target address) when the target address is
available for routing.  The core will continue granting credit to the
link as long as the address is routable.  The core ties the
replenishment of credit with the settlement of messages arriving on
the link: when the message is settled a single credit is granted by
the core.  All credit flow operations involve having the core put a
credit flow work event on the proper inbound link then waking the
worker thread to update the credit in proton.

The core can be the destination or source of AMQP message flows
from/to clients outside the router.  This is used by services like the
Management Agent to receive management requests and send responses to
management clients.  The core sends and receives these messages in
exactly the same way it forwards routed traffic - via the worker
threads.

The core thread's main loop is driven by a work queue (the
qdr_core_t's action_list).  The core thread blocks on a mutex
condition waiting for work.  When a worker thread needs a service from
the core thread, the worker queues a work item to the action_list then
triggers the condition.  This causes the core thread to unblock and
service the action_list work items.


Source Code Conventions
=======================

In general, core thread code and data structure have names that are
prefixed by "qdr_".  Functions that can only be run on the core thread
- that cannot be invoked from the context of a worker thread - are
suffixed with "_CT".  For example "qdr_update_delivery_CT()" is a core
function that must never be invoked by a worker thread.

Code that is private to the Core thread is in the "src/router_core"
subdirectory of the source code repo.

Worker thread code does not have a particular naming convention. Most
worker thread-only APIs do start with "qd_", but this prefix is not
reserved for worker thread APIs.


Principal Data Structures
=========================

There are many data structures that are used throughout the code.
This section will overview a few of those data structures which are
involved in inter-thread communications.

qdr_delivery_t
--------------

The qdr_delivery_t structure represents the router's view of a Proton
delivery instance (pn_delivery_t).  Its definition is private to core,
however core defines an API that allows a worker to concurrently
access parts of this structure.

There is a one-to-one relationship between a qdr_delivery_t and a
Proton pn_delivery_t.  When an incoming message arrives at the router
a new incoming qdr_delivery_t is created and tied to the message's
pn_delivery_t.  When a message is forwarded a new outgoing
qdr_delivery_t is created to associate with the outgoing link's
pn_delivery_t.

It is important to understand that pn_delivery_t's - and by extension
qdr_delivery_t's - are "owned" by the parent pn_link_t
(qdr_link_t). This means that a delivery object cannot be moved from
an inbound link to an outbound link - which seems counterintiutive to
the process of routing a message.

In reality when an inbound delivery is routed, the router create a new
outbound delivery for each outbound link.  These outbound deliveries
are also represented by their own pn_delivery_t and qdr_delivery_t
instances.

The core thread links the inbound and outbound qdr_deliver_t's
together.  This makes it trival to determine the "peer" of any
delivery that is being forwarded.

Note that a single inbound qdr_delivery_t may be linked to
more than one outgoing qdr_delivery_t in the case of multicast
forwarding.

A qdr_delivery_t state includes:

 *) the delivery's disposition (local and remote)
 *) the delivery's settlement state
 *) a reference to the AMQP message (qd_message_t *)

The qdr_delivery_t structure is defined in src/router_core/delivery.h

qd_message_t
------------

The qd_message_t structure represents a delivery's interface to an
AMQP message.  A qd_message_t is shared between core and worker
threads.  The qd_message_t contains a mutex to guarantee consistency.

qd_message_t is actually an alias for a structure that is private to
the message.c module called 'qd_message_pvt_t'. For simplicity this
document will use the public name 'qd_message_t' when referring to
this structure.

Despite the name the qd_message_t is not the actual AMQP message
data.  Rather it is an interface between a qdr_delivery_t and the
actual AMQP message data.  There is a one-to-one relationship between
a qdr_delivery_t and its associated qd_message_t.  Since a single
routed message may have several qdr_delivery_t's referencing it
(inbound, outbound(s)), there are multiple qd_message_t's that share
the same physical AMQP message data.

The actual message data is represented by a qd_message_content_t
structure which is private to the message.c module.

Here's a rough depiction of the implementation:

  +-------------------+             +--------------------+
  | in qdr_delivery_t |<----------->| out qdr_delivery_t |
  +-------------------+             +--------------------+
           ^                                 ^
           |                                 |
           V                                 V
    +--------------+                  +--------------+
    | qd_message_t |                  | qd_message_t |
    +------+-------+                  +-------+------+
           |                                  |
           |     +----------------------+     |
           +---->| qd_message_content_t |<----+
                 +---------+------------+
                           |     +-------------+
                           +---> | qd_buffer_t | --> ...
                                 +-------------+

This allows the sharing of a single instance of message data among
multiple deliveries without the need for copying actual message data.

The qd_message_t maintains state that corresponds to its associated
qdr_delivery_t.  This includes:

 *) a cursor into the message body
 *) header value overrides that apply only to the assoicated delivery.

Each delivery requires its own cursor into the message body.

The inbound delivery's qd_message_t maintains a "write" cursor which
points to the end of message's buffer chain.  New data arriving for
the message on the inbound delivery is appended at this cursor.

Since outgoing deliveries can send data at different rates (due to
network buffering, etc), each outgoing delivery's qd_message_t
maintains a "read" cursor which points to the next byte to be sent on
the delivery.

For reasons beyond the scope of this document the router needs to be
able to override the value of the inbound message's annotations for
each forwarded message.  These new message annotations can vary across
multiple outgoing deliveries.  To support this the qd_message_t also
holds per-destination message annotation overrides.

qdr_link_t
----------

The router defines two separate structures representing a Proton
pn_link_t: a 'qd_link_t' and a 'qdr_link_t'.  The qd_link_t structure
is owned by the worker thread(s), while the qdr_link_t is the core's
own representation.

The qd_link_t is a small structure containing references to the Proton
pn_link_t and parent pn_session_t.  Only the worker thread currently
processing the parent Proton connection may call into Proton using
these references. It is not ment to be shared with the core thread.

The qdr_link_t is a much bigger (more complex?) structure and is
directly shared between worker and core threads.  Consistency is
maintained by a mutex that is owned by the qdr_link_t's parent
qdr_connection_t structure (see below).

qdr_link_t is a container for qdr_delivery_t instances.  qdr_link_t's
corresponding to an inbound AMQP link hold all inbound
qdr_delivery_t's for that link.  Likewise an outbound AMQP link's
qdr_link_t holds all qdr_delivery_t's being sent out that link.

There are several components of the qdr_link_t that are shared between
the core and worker threads.  The most notable are:

 *) the work_list
 *) the updated_deliveries list
 *) the qdr_delivery_t lists

The work_list is a work queue used by the core to schedule work on a
worker thread.  The work includes state updates that the core needs to
be written to Proton.  Since Proton access is restricted to worker
threads, the core will add work items to this list then activate a
worker thread (via the Proactor "wakeup" event) to do the actual
processing.

There are several work events supported:

 *) QDR_LINK_WORK_FLOW - Link credit state update that needs to be
    written to Proton.
 *) QDR_LINK_WORK_FIRST/SECOND_DETACH - Core needs a link to be
    detached/closed.
 *) QDR_LINK_WORK_DELIVERY - one or more outgoing deliveries are ready
    to be sent.  This is described further later in this document.

The work_list is protected by the parent qdr_connection_t's work_lock.
The worker thread code that processes the work_list can be found in
src/router_core/connections.c::qdr_connection_process()

Note well that scheduling work via the qdr_link_t->link_work list is a
two-step process: first the work item is queued to the
qdr_link_t->work_list, then a reference to the qdr_link_t is placed in
the qdr_connection_t's links_with_work list. Once this is done, the
core activate a worker.  See below for more details.

The qdr_link_t->updated_deliveries list is a list of qdr_delivery_t
references.  Each of these deliveries have had its settlement or
disposition state modified by the core.  The core places a reference
to a delivery on this list then activates a worker thread.  The worker
thread then walks this list updating the corresponding delivery state
in Proton.  The worker thread code that processes this list is also in
qdr_connection_process().

The qdr_link_t maintains separate lists for its qdr_delivery_ts.  Each
list corresponds to the state the qdr_delivery_t is in:

 *) undelivered - these are deliveries that are being forwarded.  For
    an outgoing qdr_link_t this list is used by the worker threads to
    determine which delivery is next/currently being transmitted.
 *) unsettled - the delivery has been forwarded and is pending
    settlement from the remote.  Obviously qdr_delivery_ts on this list
    are unsettled!.
 *) settled - these deliveries are pre-settled and are not yet
    completely sent.

The core and worker threads move qdr_delivery_ts between these lists
as state changes.  Consistency is enforced by locking these lists
using the parent qdr_connection_t->work_lock mutex.

The qdr_link_t structure is defined in
src/router_core/router_core_private.h

qdr_connection_t
----------------

The qdr_connection_t structure maintains state corresponding to an
AMQP connection.  It is a container for qdr_link_t's (and by
indirection qdr_delivery_t's).  It is concurrently accessed by the
core and worker threads.

Note that the worker thread defines a qd_connection_t structure which
is used to hold a reference to the corresponding Proton
pn_connection_t.  This structure is private to the worker threads and
is not shared with core.

The qdr_connection_t maintains a mutex which acts as the "topmost"
mutex in the data structure tree.  It enforces consistency not only
for qdr_connection_t, but for its children qdr_link_t's and
qdr_delivery_t's.  This mutex is the qdr_connection_t->work_lock
member.

In addition to the critical sections for qdr_link_t described
previously, the work_lock is taken when accessing the following
qdr_connection_t members:

 *) work_list
 *) child qdr_link_t reference list
 *) list of child qdr_link_ts scheduled for work on the worker thread

The work_list is a list of qdr_connection_work_t instances.  Work is
requested by the core thread and processed by the worker thread. There
are two types of work defined:

 *) QDR_CONNECTION_WORK_FIRST_ATTACH - issued by the core thread when
    it needs a new link created on a given connection
 *) QDR_CONNECTION_WORK_SECOND_ATTACH - issued by the core in response
    to an incoming link attach.

The qdr_connection_t maintains a list of child qdr_link_t's in its
'links' list.  This is not a "high touch" list - qdr_link_t's are added
and removed as needed.  The list is also used when cleaning up a
connections resources.

The qdr_connection_t's links_with_work member is an entirely different
matter - it plays a central role in the forwarding process.

The links_with_work member is actually a fixed array of lists of
qdr_link_t references.  The array is indexed by *priority* - this is
the transmit priority associated with an outgoing address.  The router
supports 10 priority levels with 10 being the highest priority.

Forwarding a message involves having the core thread add a reference
to the message's corresponding outgoing qdr_link_t to the end of the
link_with_work list for that address's priority.  It is then up to the
worker thread to service the qdr_link_t's outgoing deliveries in
priority order.  This process is explained in detail later in this
document.


Putting It All Together
=======================

Now that the data structures associated with threading have been
described it is time to walk through a few basic router operations
describing the thread interaction that occurs.

Example 1: Endpoint Activation
------------------------------

This is the sequence of operations that occur when a new connection
and link are established to the router.

1) A worker thread is woken by the Proton proactor to service a
PN_CONNECTION_REMOTE_OPEN event.  If the policy configuration permits
the connection the worker will respond by opening the Proton
connection locally and queues a qdr_action_t to the core thread's
action list and wakes the core thread.  The action contains
connection-related information, including a new qdr_connection_t
instance.

2) The core thread processes the new connection. For normal
connections this simply involves initializing the qdr_connection_t and
storing a reference to it.

Inter router connections are more involved.  For these connections the
router will establish one inter-router link for each supported message
priority (as described above).  Therefore inter-router connections are
the only connections supporting more than one priorty link.

3) The handling of Proton session creation is totally reserved to the
worker thread.  The core does not deal with session management at all.

4) When a link attach is issued by the remote client over the
connection, the worker thread will be woken to process a
PN_LINK_REMOTE_OPEN.  The worker thread instantiates a qd_link_t and
links it to the pn_link_t.  The worker then creates a new qdr_action_t
for the core thread and includes a new qdr_link_t instance.  Note well
that the worker thread does NOT respond to the attach by opening the
link at this point.

5) The core thread then processes the link first attach action sent by
the worker.  Many things occur at this point that are beyond the scope
of this document.  Eventually the core determines if the Proton link
should be allowed.  If this is the case the core will create a
QDR_CONNECTION_WORK_SECOND_ATTACH connection work item, enqueue it to
the qdr_connection_t and wake the worker via the Proton proactor wake
call.  If the core instead decides to reject the attach, it will
create a QDR_LINK_WORK_FIRST_DETACH link work item, enqueue it to the
qdr_link_t and wake the worker.

6) The worker thread wakes and processes the work item.  In the case
of QDR_CONNECTION_WORK_SECOND_ATTACH the worker will open the Proton
pn_link_t.  If detaching the worker will close/detach the proton
pn_link_t.


Example: Credit Grant from Remote Client
----------------------------------------

1) This starts with a worker thread receiving a PN_LINK_FLOW event
from Proton.  The worker thread creates an qdr_action_t request for
the core thread.  This request includes the qdr_link_t the flow
arrived on, the credit value, and drain mode.

2) How the core thread services the flow action depends on the state
of the link.  If the link is a connected link (e.g. a link route) then
the core propagates the credit state to the peer link (see Example:
Credit Grant from Core).  Otherwise if the link is outgoing and has
pending qdr_delivery_t's queued on the qdr_link_t->undelivered list
the core puts the qdr_link_t on the qdr_connection_t's links_with_work
lists and activates the worker thread.  (See Example: Forwarding a
Message)


Example: Credit Grant from Core
-------------------------------

1) The core thread is in charge of managing credit.  When the time
comes to update or drain credit the core thread will create a
QDR_LINK_WORK_FLOW link work instance.  The core populates this with
credit information, including drain state if necessary. The work item
is then queued to the qdr_link_t link_work list.  The qdr_link_t is
then added to the proper links_with_work list in the qdr_connection_t.
The core then then wakes a worker.

2) When the worker is activated it services the links_with_work lists
in the qdr_connection_t.  For each qdr_link_t the worker services the
link's work_list.  At that point the worker thread will process the
QDR_LINK_WORK_FLOW item, updating credit state in the corresponding
pn_link_t.


Example: Forwarding a Message
-----------------------------

1) The forwarding process begins with a worker thread receiving a new
writable PN_DELIVERY event from Proton.  The worker thread will
extract the Proton pn_link_t from its qd_link_t, and get the current
active Proton delivery.  Using this delivery it attempts to read in an
AMQP message.  This results in either a new qd_message_t or an update
to an existing qd_message_t (think streaming data).

The worker will start the forwarding process when enough of the
message has arrived to be able to determine the destination address.
In this case the worker creates a new qdr_delivery_t and issues a
"link_deliver" action to the core thread.

2) The core thread forwards the delivery by looking up the destination
address in its route table and determining the outgoing links
corresponding to the address.  For each outgoing link, the core
creates a new outgoing qdr_delivery_t and qd_message_t pair that are
tied to the incoming qdr_delivery_t and qd_message_t.  The core then
puts these outgoing qdr_deliver_t's on their parent
qdr_link_t->undelivered delivery list.

The core thread then adds a new QDR_LINK_WORK_DELIVERY work item to
each outgoing qdr_link_t.  The core also puts the outgoing qdr_link_t's
onto their parent qdr_connection_t->link_with_work lists (at the
proper priority).  Once this is all done the core wakes the worker
threads.

3) The worker thread services each qdr_link_t on the
qdr_connection_t->links_with_work list in priority order.  For each
qdr_link_t it processes the qdr_link_t->work_list.  For the
QDR_LINK_WORK_DELIVERY, the worker starts at the head of the
qdr_link_t->undelivered list and starts writing the message content to
the Proton link.  Note well that the first time this is attempted for
a qdr_delivery_t there will be no corresponding pn_delivery_t since it
has not been created yet (it cannot be created by the core thread when
the core creates the new outgoing qdr_delivery_t). In this case the
worker will create a new pn_delivery_t for the new qdr_delivery_t.

The worker thread will continue writing message data until the link's
credit is exhausted or all deliveries have been sent.  In the case of
unsettled messages the worker will move completed qdr_delivery_t's from
the qdr_link_t->undelivered list to qdr_link_t->unsettled list.

Example: Propagating Disposition and Settlement
-----------------------------------------------

1) Continuing the example above, let's examine what happens when the
remote consumer sets the final disposition and settles the received
delivery.  This causes a PN_DELIVERY event to be sent to a worker
thread.  The worker thread then creates a core action containing the
corresponding qdr_delivery_t and the updated disposition data.  If the
remote has settled the worker thread immediately settles the
pn_delivery_t.  The worker then dispatches the action to the core.


2) The core services the request by propagating the new state from the
source qdr_delivery_t to its "downstream" peers.  Remember that an
inbound qdr_delivery_t is linked to all of its outbound deliveries by
the core when the delivery is forwarded.  These links are
bi-directional and are used by the core to determine which
qdr_delivery_t(s) the disposition/settlement needs to be propagated
to.  For each peer qdr_delivery_t the core updates the desired
disposition and settlement to match the change.  It then puts a
reference to the updated qdr_delivery_t into its parent
qdr_link_t->updated_deliveries list.  The core finally puts the
qdr_link_t's onto their parent qdr_connection_t->links_with_work lists
and schedules a worker thread to service them.

3) The worker thread is activated and starts servicing the
qdr_connection_t->links_with_work lists.  For each qdr_link_t it
services, the worker drains the qdr_link_t->updated_deliveries list.
The worker compares the disposition state and settlement in the
qdr_delivery_t against the corresponding state in the Proton
pn_delivery_t.  The worker updates the pn_delivery_t as necessary,
including settling it.
